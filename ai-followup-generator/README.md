# AI Follow-Up Generator

## Overview
The AI Follow-Up Generator is a Flask-based web application that analyzes user-AI conversations and generates relevant follow-up questions. It helps improve dialogue coherence by identifying missing details or areas needing clarification.

## Features
- **Context Analysis**: Identifies gaps and missing details in AI responses.
- **Follow-Up Suggestions**: Generates 2-3 follow-up questions to refine the conversation.
- **Web Interface**: User-friendly UI to enter prompts and view suggestions.
- **Azure OpenAI Integration**: Uses Azure OpenAI's GPT-4 for analysis and suggestion generation.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS
- **AI Model**: Azure OpenAI GPT-4

## API Reference
### `/` (GET & POST)
**Method:** `POST`
- **Inputs:**
  - `user_prompt`: The user's original message.
  - `ai_response`: The AI-generated response.

## Assumptions & Limitations
- The model relies on Azure OpenAI GPT-4, which may have response variability.
- UI is minimalistic for demonstration purposes.
- Additional refinements (e.g., NLP pre-processing) could enhance accuracy.

---

## Future Enhancements
